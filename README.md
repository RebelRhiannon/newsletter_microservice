# newsletter_microservice - README

---
**Overview**
This microservice allows users to:
1) Subscribe to a monthly cybersecurity newsletter
2) Check their subscription status
3) Update their email address
4) Unsubscribe from the newsletter
5) Send the newsletter to all subscribers

It is built with Python (flask) and currently uses **Mailtrap SMTP** for email testing. 
To send real emails, this must be replaced with Mailgun or another SMTP provider.

**TroubleShooting**
1) Microservice doesn't start
   This might be due to missing dependencies. Try running pip install -r requirements.txt
2) Emails not sending
   This might be due to incorrect Mailtrap Credentials. Verify your Mailtrap_user and mailtrap_pass
3) No response from API
   This could be due to the Flask not running. Ensure python app.py is running.
